/*
const ---> constant // cant be changed once declared

var---> was used earlier but due to scope issues , is not being used


let ---> removes all the problem caused by var 
, dont have any scope issue


accountCity = "Jaipur"  --> not a good practice but this is also a good way to declare a variable


let accountState; --> undefined
